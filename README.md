# 100 Days of Svelte

## A personal challenge to encourage rapid prototyping, better UI design skills, and practice developing experiences.


### The Longer Version

I decided to take the 100 Days of Design from [DailyUI](https://dailyui.co) and push it one step further. Rotating through 10 popular industries, each day a design is crafted to spec for the given prompt, developed using Svelte, and hosted -- currently on Vercel.


### The Rules

- All pages are independent.
    - This means separate CSS files. Repitition is half of the point of this project.
- All tools are on the table.
    - Render however, host whereever, custom or prebuilt components...
    - As long as Svelte is used and the design matches the concept, go nuts.
- All pages should be fully responsive.
- All pages should be fully accessible.


### The Why

This project allows practice with rapid prototyping, improves knowledge of a framework and its community, and provides training wheels for taming the scope monster by applying a faux deadline. In addition to the deadline, the page is already designed, so having the end product already in mind enforces the 'good enough' mentality and encourages you to move on and continue learning.
